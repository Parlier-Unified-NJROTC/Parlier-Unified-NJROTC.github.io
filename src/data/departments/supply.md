# Description


The Supply department is the backbone of our unit's logistics and accountability. They manage thousands of dollars worth of equipment with meticulous care — receiving, storing, and maintaining items so they are ready when cadets need them. Every piece of gear is logged, archived, and tracked in detailed inventory records, ensuring nothing is lost and every item is accounted for.

Their flawless track record reflects a commitment to precision and responsibility. When supplies are needed, the Supply team is unmatched at distributing gear quickly and accurately, supporting training, events, and competitions without delay.

Reliable, organized, and professional — the Supply department consistently ensures our cadets have the equipment they need to succeed.
