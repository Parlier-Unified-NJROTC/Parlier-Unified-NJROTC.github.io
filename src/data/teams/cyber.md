# CyberPatriot Team

## Description

CyberPatriot is a national youth cyber defense competition that challenges teams to secure and manage virtual networks and systems under time pressure. Our Cyber team pairs IT operations and programming practice so cadets learn both how systems are defended and how to build tools that help automate and secure them.

### IT

In IT we focus on practical defensive skills used in CyberPatriot rounds and real-world administration:

- System hardening and secure configuration (Windows & Linux)
- Network fundamentals and services (DHCP, DNS, HTTP/HTTPS)
- Monitoring, incident response, and basic forensics
- Virtualization, imaging, and patch management
- Account, permission, and service management

### Programming

Our team specializes in programming and web development. We teach reasearching skills and knowledge in Javascript, Express, and Astro. This allows us to create projects and tools for the unit and our own needs. 

We are also the people respondsible for the website, if there are any request please let us know.
