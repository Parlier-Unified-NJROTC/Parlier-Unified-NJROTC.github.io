<blockquote>
  The Parlier NJROTC Color Guard is a specialized team responsible for presenting and carrying the National Ensign and the Navy flag at ceremonies, parades, and official events. The team practices precise drill movements that require discipline, coordination, and teamwork, helping cadets build confidence and develop stronger leadership skills.
